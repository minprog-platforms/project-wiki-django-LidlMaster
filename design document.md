# Design Document Wiki

In this project a webpage will be constructed that will form a simplistic form of Wikipedia.
On this page it will be possible to see all entries on the homepage, create a new entry, visit a random page and search for and visit an entry. When an entry isnâ€™t available an error page will be displayed.

## Index
On this page the user will be able to navigate to the available entries, these will be listed on the main body. The user will also be able to navigate to create an entry, a random page and the user will be able to input a search term to navigate to an existing entry.
